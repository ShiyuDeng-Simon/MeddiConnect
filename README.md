# MeddiConnect
nwHacks 2025 Project

Imagine walking out of a doctor’s office and realizing you’ve already forgotten half of what was discussed. You’re not alone—studies show that over 50% of patients forget or misunderstand their doctor’s advice after their visit. Others record the session, only to spend hours later trying to find and revisit key insights. What if we could change that?. MediConnect is an innovative app that empowers patients by transcribing doctor-patient conversations in real-time and providing AI-generated summaries that highlight key medical terms with simple definitions—all powered by a secure, privacy-focused local language model (LLM).

Patients can take control of their healthcare journey by preparing pre-visit notes, with optional AI assistance to expand their thoughts and formulate questions. During appointments, MediConnect provides real-time transcription. After the session, the app generates a comprehensive, doctor-reviewed summary to ensure accuracy and clarity.

With MeddiConnect, we’re not just solving a common problem; we’re building a bridge of understanding between patients and doctors, ensuring that critical medical insights are never lost or misunderstood again.
